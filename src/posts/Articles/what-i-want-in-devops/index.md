# What I want out of my DevOps
#DevOps

- Quick to production
- High-availability (means horizontally scaled, at least 3 “nodes”)
- Be able to use SQLite
- CI/CD such that once we wire up a git repo, any commits to “main” will trigger rolling updates in the deployments
- Monitoring + basic observability
